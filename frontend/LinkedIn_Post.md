Just finished working on something I'm really proud of - Quran Kareem, a web application for the Muslim community.

After months of development, I built this Islamic web app using React to help Muslims with their daily religious practices:

**What it includes:**
- Complete Quran with all 114 Surahs and audio recitation
- Prayer times that automatically adjust to your location  
- Daily Azkar collections for morning, evening, and after prayers
- Audio playback for Quranic verses
- Clean, responsive design with proper Arabic text support
- Location-based prayer time calculations

**Built with:**
- React 19 and Vite
- Lucide React for icons
- Several Islamic APIs
- Custom CSS styling
- Geolocation services

This was a personal project that let me combine my coding skills with creating something meaningful for my community. I wanted to build tools that Muslims actually use every day in a simple, clean interface.

Next up I'm thinking about adding Qibla direction, Islamic calendar integration, and making it work offline.
